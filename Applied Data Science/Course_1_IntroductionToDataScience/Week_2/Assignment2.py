# # Assignment 2 - Pandas Introduction
# All questions are weighted the same in this assignment.
# ## Part 1
# The following code loads the olympics dataset (olympics.csv), which was derrived
# from the Wikipedia entry on
# [All Time Olympic Games Medals]
# (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table),
# and does some basic data cleaning. Use this dataset to answer the questions below.

# In[1]:

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('olympics.csv', index_col=0, skiprows=1)

# print( 'Before cleaning' )
# print( df.head() )
for col in df.columns:
    if col[:2]=='01':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Gold'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='02':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Silver'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='03':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Bronze'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:1]=='â„–':
        df.rename(columns={col:'#'+col[1:]}, inplace=True)

# split the index by '('
names_ids = df.index.str.split('\s\(') 

# the [0] element is the country name (new index)
df.index = names_ids.str[0] 
# the [1] element is the abbreviation or ID (take first 3 characters from that)
df['ID'] = names_ids.str[1].str[:3]

df = df.drop('Totals')

# print( '\n\n ****************  After cleaning' )
# print( df.head() )


# ### Question 0 (Example)
# 
# What is the first country in df?
# 
# *This function should return a Series.*

# In[4]:

# You should write your whole answer within the function provided. The autograder
# will call
# this function and compare the return value against the correct solution value
def answer_zero():
    """
    # This function returns the row for Afghanistan, which is a Series object.
    The assignment question description will tell you the general format the 
    autograder is expecting

# You can examine what your function returns by calling it in the cell.

# about the assignment formats, check out the discussion forums for any FAQs

# ### Question 1
# Which country has won the most gold medals in summer games?

# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# ### Question 3
# Which country has the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts
# relative to their total gold medal count? Only include countries that have won at least
# 1 gold in both summer and winter.
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[ ]:

# ### Question 4
# Write a function to update the dataframe to include a new column called "Points" which is a
# weighted value where each gold medal counts for 3 points, silver medals for 2 points, and
# bronze mdeals for 1 point. The function should return only the column (a Series object)
# which you created.

# *This function should return a Series named `Points` of length 146*

# ## Part 2
# For the next set of questions, we will be using census data from the [United States Census Bureau]
# (http://www.census.gov/popest/data/counties/totals/2015/CO-EST2015-alldata.html). Counties are
# political and geographic subdivisions of states in the United States. This dataset contains
# population data for counties and states in the US from 2010 to 2015. [See this document]
# (http://www.census.gov/popest/data/counties/totals/2015/files/CO-EST2015-alldata.pdf) for a
# description of the variable names.
# 
# The census dataset (census.csv) should be loaded as census_df. Answer questions using this
# as appropriate.
#

# ### Question 5
# Which state has the most counties in it? (hint: consider the sumlevel key
# carefully! You'll need this for future questions too...)
